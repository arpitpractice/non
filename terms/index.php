            <h3>Mandatory Arbitration</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Please read this provision carefully. It requires that any and all claims must be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court, and it prevents you from pursuing a class action or similar proceeding in any forum. These limitations apply to any claims against jamaliate, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any service service providers or companies offering products or services through the site. 
                <br/><br/>
            </p>

            <h3> In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. The arbitrator's decision will generally be final and binding, with no right of appeal. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than court procedures.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By using this Site, you, any Third-party, and jamaliate agree that any Claim, including claims regarding the applicability or validity of this arbitration provision, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the then applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA ("Rules and Procedures"), except that, pursuant to subsection (e) below, under no circumstances may any claim be brought or arbitrated as a class action or be joined with another person's claim, or proceed on a basis involving claims brought on a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of the general public or other users or persons). 

                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    As an exception to arbitration, you, any Third-party, and jamaliate retain the right to pursue in a small claims court located in the federal judicial district that includes you or the Third-party’s billing address at the time of the Claim, any Claim that is within the court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis. All Claims you or a Third-party bring against jamaliate, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any service service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site must be resolved in accordance with this Disputes and Arbitration Section. All Claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed and void.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>

                    If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") addressed to: Legal Department, jamaliate.com, 1270 Romney Rd Bloomfield hills Michigan 48304 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If jamaliate and you, or jamaliate and any Third-party, do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the Third-party, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you, any Third-party, or jamaliate is entitled.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to arbitration and proceeds in a Court other than small claims court, such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court for Michigan or, if there is no federal jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State of Michigan located in Fairfield County, Michigan. You hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the arbitration provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any such claim shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. You further agree that any and all Claims or other matters asserted in such dispute, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to conflict of laws provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    You and any third-party further agree that no proceeding against jamaliate, its affiliates, or any service service providers or companies offering products or services through the site (under this provision or otherwise) may proceed as a class action, be joined with another person’s claim, or proceed on a basis involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of the general public or other users or persons). Any and all proceedings to resolve claims will be conducted only on an individual basis. In addition, no arbitration proceeding under this provision shall be consolidated or joined in any way with any other arbitration proceeding without the express written consent of all parties.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    For any arbitration initiated pursuant to this agreement involving Claims that together seek damages that do not exceed $25 jamaliate will reimburse you for all fees and costs imposed by AAA. If you are unable to pay the filing fee, jamaliate will p'ay it for you. For any arbitration involving Claims that together seek damages that exceed $25, if you, or any Third-party, prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against jamaliate, jamaliate will reimburse such prevailing party for any fees or costs the prevailing party paid to AAA in connection with the arbitration.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    If you prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against jamaliate and are awarded an amount greater than jamaliate’s last written settlement offer to you, jamaliate will pay a minimum recovery of $5 and jamaliate will reimburse you for all reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim(s) upon which you have prevailed. If any Third-party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against jamaliate and is awarded an amount greater than jamaliate’s last written settlement offer to such Third-party, jamaliate will pay a minimum recovery of $5 to the Third-party, and jamaliate will reimburse such Third-party for all reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim upon which he or she has prevailed. Any dispute regarding attorney’s fees to be paid pursuant to this paragraph will be decided by the arbitrator who decided the underlying Claim. If you or the Third-party do not prevail on the claim or prevail but are awarded an amount less than or equal to jamaliate’s last written settlement offer to you, jamaliate will pay only the amount of the award, not the minimum recovery or attorneys’ fees.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>

                    Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and Procedures established by AAA which may be to the contrary, jamaliate will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its attorney’s fees for any Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.
                </li>
                <br/><br/>
                <li>
                    With the exception of sub-part (e) above (the class action waiver), if any part of this arbitration provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) above (the class action waiver) is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor any Third-party, nor jamaliate shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
