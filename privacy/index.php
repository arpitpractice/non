                This policy describes Jamaliate’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data (“personal information”). This policy applies to our websites, applications, email and text messages, and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>The categories of Personal Information we collect</h3>
            <br />
            <p class="text-justify">
                When you visit the Platforms, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                If you book a travel product via the Platforms, we may need additional information from you. This information can include your name (and traveler’s if different) name, age, birthday, gender, passport number, redress control number, email address, telephone number, credit card information, billing address, itinerary and frequent flyer details. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.
            </p><p class="text-justify">
            If you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password and home airport, and other preference information you provide us. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store that information related to the account.
            </p> <p class="text-justify">
            If you make a booking on Jamaliate or within our mobile applications, we may automatically create an account for you, which will give you access to other details, where we will collect your personal information to create. This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you give us access to.
            </p><p class="text-justify">
            When you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.
            </p>
            <h3>How we collect your Personal Information</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">We collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you register or submit feedback.
                <br /><br/>
                We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect information about you over time and across different Web sites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. 
                <br /><br />
                We collect your personal information from third parties. This can include when you log in using a third party platform, such as Facebook. In addition, we also integrate third party software (i.e. Google’s Invisible CAPTCHA) that collects information about users for security reasons.
                <br /><br />
                Platform features may make use of your device attributes and settings that will allow us to determine your physical location. Such technologies may include IP address mapping, WiFi, GPS signals, cell tower positioning or other technologies. We use this information to enhance and personalize your experience and provide you with offers and services that may be of interest to you. For example, we may help you find your closest hotel or send you messages that may be of interest to you based on your current location. Jamaliate does not have control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location based features and functionality offered.</p>

            </p>
            <h3 class="text-justify">How we share your Personal Information</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                We may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for our legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information.
                <br /><br />
                If you book through the Platforms, we may share your personal information with the payment service providers and the travel vendors you have booked with. This can include online travel agencies, hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and travel insurance providers. These third parties will process your personal information as data controllers in accordance with their own privacy policies.
                <br/>
                <br />
                We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners.
                <br /><br />
                If Jamaliate itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, owners would have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.
                <br /><br />
                We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.
                <br/><br/>
                We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-justify">How we store and protect your Personal Information</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Jamaliate has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third parties to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy. In addition, information collected by Google’s Invisible CAPTCHA is held in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">Cookies and tracking tools</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Jamaliate uses cookies and tracking tools. </p>


            <h3 class="text-justify">Other Websites</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">If you click through to third party websites or other platforms, Jamaliate’s privacy policy does not apply.</p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">Children</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Jamaliate does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and Platforms after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-justify">Cookies and other tracking tools</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3 class="text-justify">Jamaliate uses tracking tools such as cookies</h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> We (or our suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Web sites when you use our Platforms. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file.
                <br /><br/>
                We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter. When you access a partner site within our mobile applications, we may track your activity on that site.
                <br /><br/>
                By using the Platforms, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy.
            </p>


            <h3 class="text-justify">Jamaliate uses tracking tools for following purposes</h3>

This targeting may be based on information you submit on our Platforms or third party platforms. This targeting may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Platforms or those of third parties. We may also obtain information about your browsing history from our business partners. To learn more about targeted advertising and how you can accept or refuse (opt-out of) this type of advertisements, we recommend that you visit <a href="www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>

                    To help improve our website offering and for capacity planning purposes. We or our third party service providers may set analytics cookies. These allow us to gather aggregated or segmented information about the types of visitors that access our Platforms and the pages and advertisements that they view.

            <h3>
                How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising
            </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information.
                <br/><br/>
                To opt out of having your online behavior tracked by Jamaliate for advertising purposes click here; this means that Jamaliate will no longer use information derived from your online behavior, collected by Jamaliate or third parties acting on behalf of Jamaliate, for the purpose of providing you interest-based advertising from Jamaliate only. Note that opting out of receiving interest-based advertising through the link above does not mean you will no longer receive advertising from Jamaliate or third parties at all; rather it means that most of the advertising that you will see will not be based on your particular interest. In addition, Jamaliate may still collect information for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Your opt out choice is stored in opt out cookies only in this browser, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers, computers, or devices you may use. If your browser blocks cookies, your opt out preferences may not be effective. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt out preferences, so you should visit this page periodically to review your preferences.
                <br/><br/>
                We may also use Google Analytics to collect demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You can find out more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out by going here. Choices you make are browser and device specific. Some aspects of our site use cookies to function. You may not be able to use these features if you set your device to block cookies. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

            </p>
            <h3>How Jamaliate responds to “Do Not Track” signals</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                If you have any questions on our use of tracking tools, please use the feedback form.
