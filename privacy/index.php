        <br />
        <p class="text-justify">
            When you visit the Platforms, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
        If you book a travel product via the Platforms, we may need additional information from you. This information can include your name (and traveler’s if different) name, age, birthday, gender, passport number, redress control number, email address, telephone number, credit card information, billing address, itinerary and frequent flyer details. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.
</p><p class="text-justify">
If you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password and home airport, and other preference information you provide us. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store that information related to the account.
</p> <p class="text-justify">
If you make a booking on Jamaliate or within our mobile applications, we may automatically create an account for you, which will give you access to other details, where we will collect your personal information to create. This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you give us access to.
</p><p class="text-justify">
When you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.
